# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation
Modern large language models and transformer architectures incur substantial compute and memory overhead during training and inference. Standard dense linear projections dominate parameter storage and GEMM execution. The `slicegpt` module addresses these computational bottlenecks through specialized compression, pruning, and low-rank projection mechanisms.

## 1.2 Architectural Positioning
Integrated into `Codes/framework/compression_engine/` and `Codes/framework/attentions/`, `slicegpt` wraps target projection layers into high-efficiency submodules while preserving representation fidelity and gradient propagation across layers.
